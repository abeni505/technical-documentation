        <p>JavaScript Can Change HTML Content
        One of many JavaScript HTML methods is getElementById().
        The example below "finds" an HTML element (with id="demo"), and changes the element content (innerHTML) to "Hello JavaScript":</p>
        <code>document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "Hello JavaScript";</code>
        <p>JavaScript accepts both double and single quotes:</p>
        <code>document.getElementById('demo').innerHTML = 'Hello JavaScript';</code>
        <p>JavaScript Can Change HTML Attribute Values</p>
        <p>JavaScript Can Change HTML Styles (CSS)
          Changing the style of an HTML element, is a variant of changing an HTML attribute:</p>
        <code>document.getElementById("demo").style.fontSize = "35px";</code>
        <p>JavaScript Can Hide HTML Elements
            Hiding HTML elements can be done by changing the display style:</p>
        <code>document.getElementById("demo").style.display = "none";</code>
        <p>JavaScript Can Show HTML Elements
          Showing hidden HTML elements can also be done by changing the display style:</p>
        <code>document.getElementById("demo").style.display = "block";</code>
        <p>Did You Know?
        JavaScript and Java are completely different languages, both in concept and design.

        JavaScript was invented by Brendan Eich in 1995, and became an ECMA standard in 1997.

        ECMA-262 is the official name of the standard. ECMAScript is the official name of the language.

        <p>A JavaScript Boolean represents one of two values: true or false.

          Boolean Values
          Very often, in programming, you will need a data type that can only have one of two values, like

          YES / NO
          ON / OFF
          TRUE / FALSE
          For this, JavaScript has a Boolean data type. It can only take the values true or false.

          The Boolean() Function
          You can use the Boolean() function to find out if an expression (or a variable) is true:</p>
          <code>Boolean(10 > 9)        // returns true</code>
          <p>Or even easier:</p>
          <code>(10 > 9)              // also returns true
          10 > 9                // also returns true</code>
          <p>Comparisons and Conditions
          The chapter JS Comparisons gives a full overview of comparison operators.

          The chapter JS Conditions gives a full overview of conditional statements.</p>
          <p>Everything With a "Value" is True</p>
          <code>100

        3.14

        -15

        "Hello"

        "false"

        7 + 1 + 3.14
        </code>
        <p>Everything Without a "Value" is False
        The Boolean value of 0 (zero) is false:</p>
        <code>var x = 0;
        Boolean(x);       // returns false</code>
        <p>Booleans Can be Objects
      Normally JavaScript booleans are primitive values created from literals:

      var x = false;

      But booleans can also be defined as objects with the keyword new:

      var y = new Boolean(false);</p>
      <code>var x = false;
      var y = new Boolean(false);

      // typeof x returns boolean
      // typeof y returns object</code>
      <p>Do not create Boolean objects. It slows down execution speed.
      The new keyword complicates the code. This can produce some unexpected results:

      When using the == operator, equal booleans are equal:</p>
      <code>var x = false;
      var y = new Boolean(false);

      // (x == y) is true because x and y have equal values</code>

      <section class="main-section" id="Javascript_variables">
        <header>Javascript variables</header>
        <p>JavaScript variables are containers for storing data values.

          In this example, x, y, and z, are variables, declared with the var keyword:</p>
          <code>var x = 5;
          var y = 6;
          var z = x + y;</code>
        <p>From the example above, you can expect:

          x stores the value 5
          y stores the value 6
          z stores the value 11</p>
          <p>Using let and const (2015)
          Before 2015, using the var keyword was the only way to declare a JavaScript variable.

          The 2015 version of JavaScript (ES6 - ECMAScript 2015) allows the use of the const keyword to define a variable that cannot be reassigned, and the let keyword to define a variable with restricted scope.

          Because it is a little complicated to describe the difference between these keywords, and because they are not supported in older browsers, the first part of this tutorial will most often use var.</p>
          <p>Much Like Algebra
              In this example, price1, price2, and total, are variables:</p>
        <code>var price1 = 5;
        var price2 = 6;
        var total = price1 + price2;</code>
        <p>In programming, just like in algebra, we use variables (like price1) to hold values.

        In programming, just like in algebra, we use variables in expressions (total = price1 + price2).

        From the example above, you can calculate the total to be 11.

        JavaScript variables are containers for storing data values.</p>
        <p>JavaScript Identifiers
        All JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names.

        These unique names are called identifiers.

        Identifiers can be short names (like x and y) or more descriptive names (age, sum, totalVolume).

        The general rules for constructing names for variables (unique identifiers) are:

        Names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs.
        Names must begin with a letter
        Names can also begin with $ and _ (but we will not use it in this tutorial)
        Names are case sensitive (y and Y are different variables)
        Reserved words (like JavaScript keywords) cannot be used as names
        JavaScript identifiers are case-sensitive.

        The Assignment Operator
        In JavaScript, the equal sign (=) is an "assignment" operator, not an "equal to" operator.

        This is different from algebra. The following does not make sense in algebra:</p>
        <code>x = x + 5</code>
        <p>In JavaScript, however, it makes perfect sense: it assigns the value of x + 5 to x.

        (It calculates the value of x + 5 and puts the result into x. The value of x is incremented by 5.)

        The "equal to" operator is written like == in JavaScript.
        JavaScript Data Types
        JavaScript variables can hold numbers like 100 and text values like "John Doe".

        In programming, text values are called text strings.

        JavaScript can handle many types of data, but for now, just think of numbers and strings.

        Strings are written inside double or single quotes. Numbers are written without quotes.

        If you put a number in quotes, it will be treated as a text string.</p>
        <code>var pi = 3.14;
        var person = "John Doe";
        var answer = 'Yes I am!';
        </code>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="JavaScript_Scope">
        <header>JavaScript Scope</header>
        <p>Scope determines the accessibility (visibility) of variables.</p>
        <p>JavaScript Function Scope
          In JavaScript there are two types of scope:

          Local scope
          Global scope
          JavaScript has function scope: Each function creates a new scope.

          Scope determines the accessibility (visibility) of these variables.

          Variables defined inside a function are not accessible (visible) from outside the function.

          Local JavaScript Variables
          Variables declared within a JavaScript function, become LOCAL to the function.

          Local variables have Function scope: They can only be accessed from within the function.</p>
        <code>// code here can NOT use carName

        function myFunction() {
          var carName = "Volvo";

          // code here CAN use carName

        }</code>
      <p>Since local variables are only recognized inside their functions, variables with the same name can be used in different functions.

        Local variables are created when a function starts, and deleted when the function is completed.

      </p>
      <p>Global JavaScript Variables
      A variable declared outside a function, becomes GLOBAL.

      A global variable has global scope: All scripts and functions on a web page can access it. </p>
      <code>var carName = "Volvo";

      // code here can use carName

      function myFunction() {

        // code here can also use carName

      }</code>
      <p>JavaScript Variables
      In JavaScript, objects and functions are also variables.
      Scope determines the accessibility of variables, objects, and functions from different parts of the code.
      Automatically Global
      If you assign a value to a variable that has not been declared, it will automatically become a GLOBAL variable.

      This code example will declare a global variable carName, even if the value is assigned inside a function.</p>
      <code>myFunction();

      // code here can use carName

      function myFunction() {
        carName = "Volvo";
      }</code>
      <p>Strict Mode
      All modern browsers support running JavaScript in "Strict Mode".

      You will learn more about how to use strict mode in a later chapter of this tutorial.

      In "Strict Mode", undeclared variables are not automatically global.

      Global Variables in HTML
      With JavaScript, the global scope is the complete JavaScript environment.

      In HTML, the global scope is the window object. All global variables belong to the window object.</p>
      <code>var carName = "Volvo";

      // code here can use window.carName</code>
      <p>Warning
      Do NOT create global variables unless you intend to.

      Your global variables (or functions) can overwrite window variables (or functions).
      Any function, including the window object, can overwrite your global variables and functions.

      The Lifetime of JavaScript Variables
      The lifetime of a JavaScript variable starts when it is declared.

      Local variables are deleted when the function is completed.

      In a web browser, global variables are deleted when you close the browser window (or tab).

      Function Arguments
      Function arguments (parameters) work as local variables inside functions.</p>

      <section class="main-section" id="JavaScript_Functions">
        <header>JavaScript Functions</header>
        <p>A JavaScript function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task.
          A JavaScript function is executed when "something" invokes it (calls it).</p>
          <code>function myFunction(p1, p2) {
          return p1 * p2;   // The function returns the product of p1 and p2
          }</code>
        <p>JavaScript Function Syntax
        A JavaScript function is defined with the function keyword, followed by a name, followed by parentheses ().

        Function names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs (same rules as variables).

        The parentheses may include parameter names separated by commas:
        (parameter1, parameter2, ...)

        The code to be executed, by the function, is placed inside curly brackets: {}</p>
        <code>function name(parameter1, parameter2, parameter3) {
          // code to be executed
        }</code>
        <p>Function parameters are listed inside the parentheses () in the function definition.

        Function arguments are the values received by the function when it is invoked.

        Inside the function, the arguments (the parameters) behave as local variables.

        A Function is much the same as a Procedure or a Subroutine, in other programming languages.

        Function Invocation
        The code inside the function will execute when "something" invokes (calls) the function:

        When an event occurs (when a user clicks a button)
        When it is invoked (called) from JavaScript code
        Automatically (self invoked)
        You will learn a lot more about function invocation later in this tutorial.


        Function Return
        When JavaScript reaches a return statement, the function will stop executing.

        If the function was invoked from a statement, JavaScript will "return" to execute the code after the invoking statement.

        Functions often compute a return value. The return value is "returned" back to the "caller":</p>
        <code>var x = myFunction(4, 3);   // Function is called, return value will end up in x

        function myFunction(a, b) {
          return a * b;             // Function returns the product of a and b
        }</code>
        <p>The result in x will be:12</p>
